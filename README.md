## API Token

To use the OpenWeatherMap API, you need to sign up for a free account and get your personal API token. Once you have your token, create a `.env.example` file in the root directory of the project and add the following line:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_token_here
```

Replace `your_api_token_here` with your actual API token.

**Note:** Make sure not to commit your API token to version control.
